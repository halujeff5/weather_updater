# weather_updater

This app takes API data from openweaether.com from a user specified city and displays it. It displays current temperature, 
weather conditions, humidity, air pressure, and coordinates of the city. I also built a save feature into the app where
the user can save past cities that user has searched for. This app is built with a Flask backend and is the first project 
I wrote.
